Chime
=====

Chime is a Mac (and eventually iOS) framework that provides Objective-C wrappers around the clang library's indexing functionality.

Currently, it is very rudimentary, and has been released primarily as a promised complement to the [Edge Cases](http://edgecasesshow.com) episode ["Indexing with Clang"](http://edgecasesshow.com/78).

Since documentation and functionality are both scarce, I would recommend listening to the episode first to get a sense of what's going on.

Then, try out the two sample projects, the command-line utility chimesimpletester, and the GUI app Chime Project Indexer. Both require 10.9.

I hope to provide additional functionality shortly.
